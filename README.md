*A note on all projects: I merged a few Github old accounts into this new "clean" one since the GA course required an annoying mix of Github Enterprise and personal Github accounts. It was confusing and full of other in-class exercise mess. It's why you won't see commits from this account dating prior to February, but if you dig into the projects you can see the work I committed using my other GitHub accounts (cbeattie and cbeattie2).
All projects here were done in about 5 days so are very much MVPs at this stage, but I will continue to work on them when I get the time.*

# DONSEY
https://to-do-list-donsey.herokuapp.com/

## Technologies used
MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)
Bootstrap

## Approach
To create a simple to-do list app where users can create multiple lists and save them to their account.

## User stories
As a user: 
- I want to create lists with pre-defined categories (work, home, etc.)
- I want to track my to-do items by adding them to a list
- I want to be able to mark the item as done by clicking on a checkbox
- I want the item to disappear from the list once it's done
- I want to be able to store my lists and to-do items with my user account so I can acccess them later or on another browser

As an admin user:
- I want all the abilities of a normal user
- I want to create and edit the pre-defined categories
- I want to see a list of all users and delete them
