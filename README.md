## User stories
As a user: 
- I want to create lists with pre-defined categories (work, home, etc.)
- I want to track my to-do items by adding them to a list
- I want to be able to mark the item as done by clicking on a checkbox
- I want the item to disappear from the list once it's done
- I want to be able to store my lists and to-do items with my user account so I can acccess them later or on another browser

As an admin user:
- I want all the abilities of a normal user
- I want to create and edit the pre-defined categories
- I want to see a list of all users and delete them
